# Solubility Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using machine learning models. By leveraging molecular descriptors such as **MolLogP**, **Molecular Weight (MolWt)**, **Number of Rotatable Bonds**, and **Aromatic Proportion**, we can estimate the solubility of compounds. Two models have been trained and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**

This repository provides a detailed walkthrough of how the data is prepared, the models are trained, and their performance is evaluated. Both models are compared using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.
